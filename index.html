            <p class="text-small">In this world of 7 billion people we need to educate all of them. This is the future of an educated world and we are proud to say that The Future Of Education Is Here
                As the internet has facilitated seamless communication of people around the planet, the physical divides between us will
                soon disappear. We can already see that millions of young Chinese are being taught by tutors in Western countries
                through webcams, and this trend will only continue.

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Transforming Education In India!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track
        to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to
        educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc),
        in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored,
        India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
        
        We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set
        should be on the key agenda list…
        
        For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is
        irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric
        approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.
        
        I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else it might turn out
        to be too late.
        
        Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects could also be considered.
        
        Also, in the +2 scheme students should be very well allowed to study different subjects from any stream because in the
        21st century no subject will survive in isolation, it is very much integrated hence no boundaries of ‘Stream’ should
        prevail…
        
        For example, financial technologies or biotechnology or behavioural economics, all are major upcoming fields from
        different subject specializations.
        
        A shift from the theoretical framework to a practical framework will certainly help the cause.
        
        I do understand that in a country as big and diverse as ours it is surely “easier said than done” but it surely should
        be on the top of the government bucket list.
        
        Small steps can be taken if the whole “revolution” seems unfeasible. Sports and Yoga too are great ideas that very well
        should be incorporated in the school curriculum and the govt is doing good on this…
        
        Lastly, education as rightly is incomplete with the right value sets… somewhat a spirit of coordination should prevail
        over competition among students today which largely seems missing… a rat race for marks only highlights the state of
        education as on now…</p>

            <br>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The participatory element of the multi-method study drew heavily on the principles of community-based participatory
            research (CBPR). Using a participatory approach to understand childhood experiences is important (Kehily, 2004). CBPR
            involves respectful collaboration with the community: mutual dialogue, shared decision-making and low levels of
            hierarchy actively involve community-based actors in planning, data collection, analysis and dissemination (Greenwood,
            Fakih, Steff, Bechange, & Mwifadhi, 2016). It is an orientation for research that recognises the strengths of each
            participant and seeks to break down social injustice and the structural constraints that produce inequities of power
            (Levine-Rasky, 2015). It demands an awareness of positionality with vigilance towards one’s own power (Pain, Kindon, &
            Kesby, 2007). CBPR increases knowledge and understanding of the situation being studied, constructs meaning together and
            integrates this into interventions and policy change to improve the quality of life for those of focus in the community
            (Greenwood et al., 2016).
            
            Specific to disability, CBPR can enable community members, including people with disabilities, to identify key barriers
            to achieving the SDGs and inform how policy and programs can best meet the needs of people with disabilities (Greenwood,
            2017). In the context of the wider study, this approach helped to build a picture of and the implications stemming from:
            experiences of disability, inclusion, learning and developmental progress; factors influencing non-enrolment and
            absenteeism; barriers to learning and progress; and accountability and support channels. The CBPR element drew on
            established ethical principles associated with the methodology: mutual respect, equality and inclusion, democratic
            participation, active learning, making a difference, collective action and personal integrity (Centre for Social Justice
            and Community Action (CSJCA) & National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE), 2012 cited in Greenwood et
            al., 2016). Ethical permission was approved by the National Committee on Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities,
            the National Commission for Science and Technology in Malawi, and the Humanities & Social Sciences Ethical Review
            Committee, University of Birmingham. Ethical considerations were discussed in depth between the University of Birmingham
            and Chancellor College, Malawi, including CBPR ethical principles, informed consent and the nature of confidentiality.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">We already faced a learning crisis before the pandemic.
            
            More than 250 million school-age children were out of school.
            
            And only a quarter of secondary school children in developing countries were leaving school with basic skills.
            
            Now we face a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and
            exacerbate entrenched inequalities.
            
            The knock-on effects on child nutrition, child marriage and gender equality, among others, are deeply concerning.
            
            This is the backdrop to the Policy Brief I am launching today, together with a new campaign with education partners and
            United Nations agencies called ‘Save our Future’.
            
            We are at a defining moment for the world’s children and young people.
            
            The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people,
            and on the development prospects of countries for decades to come.
            
            This Policy Brief calls for action in four key areas:
            
            First, reopening schools.
            
            Once local transmission of COVID-19 is under control, getting students back into schools and learning institutions as
            safely as possible must be a top priority.
            
            We have issued guidance to help governments in this complex endeavour.
            
            It will be essential to balance health risks against risks to children’s education and protection, and to factor in the
            impact on women’s labour force participation.
            
            Consultation with parents, carers, teachers and young people is fundamental.
            
            Second, prioritizing education in financing decisions.
            
            Before the crisis hit, low and middle-income countries already faced an education funding gap of $1.5 trillion dollars a
            year.
            
            This gap has now grown.
            
            Education budgets need to be protected and increased.
            
            And it is critical that education is at the heart of international solidarity efforts, from debt management and stimulus
            packages to global humanitarian appeals and official development assistance.
            
            Third, targeting the hardest to reach.
            
            Education initiatives must seek to reach those at greatest risk of being left behind -- people in emergencies and
            crises; minority groups of all kinds; displaced people and those with disabilities.
            
            They should be sensitive to the specific challenges faced by girls, boys, women and men, and should urgently seek to
            bridge the digital divide.
            
            Fourth, the future of education is here.
            
            We have a generational opportunity to reimagine education.
            
            We can take a leap towards forward-looking systems that deliver quality education for all as a springboard for the
            Sustainable Development Goals.
            
            To achieve this, we need investment in digital literacy and infrastructure, an evolution towards learning how to learn,
            a rejuvenation of life-long learning and strengthened links between formal and non-formal education.</p>
